# _The Last of Us Part II_ - English reviews

For my Master's thesis, I have dowloaded lazaro97's dataset containing the reviews for the games of _The Last of Us_'s series. My aim was discourse analysis, so I have cleaned and pre-processed his csv file on the users' reviews of _The Last of Us Part II_ to obtain two text files, one containing all the reviews in English having a score of zero, the other the English reviews with a score of 10.

This repository contains three files:
- The notebook with the code I made to transform the original file
- The text file with the positive reviews
- The text file with the negative reviews
